SP_Coursework
======

Our course project assignment was to write a 'compiler' for a small subset of assembly language. While original assignment asked us to mimic 16 bit MASM for DOS, I did not like the idea of writing something like that and asked to mimic GNU Assembler for x86_64 Linux in my project. Suprisingly, I was allowed to. You can observe the results.

I had to learn many new and exciting things, and even looked through the actual GNU Assembler code for inspiration. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish with *no* compiler theory knowledge (teacher didn't tell us any of that, only the MASM basics and 'Oh, yeah, go write your own one!'). Now I have a little of that knowledge, had written a high-level language compiler in Python and am a bit horrified of some things I did a year ago.

Please take note

This program was written a whole year ago, under unforgivingly tight deadlines, with unusual assignment (so nobody could help me with it) so some compromises were inevitable. Also I did not have the knowledge required to do it correctly, nor the time to do proper research.

I consider this code not nice and apologize to all who will read it.
